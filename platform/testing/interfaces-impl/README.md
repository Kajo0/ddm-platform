# Model interface testing

This project is dedicated to locally run algorithm custom implementations which use platform interfaces.
It contains set of classes which simulates distributed execution in non-distributed environment.

## Sample usage

The sample test case running pipeline with configuration of
the [`../../algorithms/clustering/aoptkm/`](../../algorithms/clustering/aoptkm/) algorithm is located
in [DdmPipelineRunnerSpec.groovy](./src/test/groovy/pl/edu/pw/ddm/platform/testing/interfaces/impl/DdmPipelineRunnerSpec.groovy)
